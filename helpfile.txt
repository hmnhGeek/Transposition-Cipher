Welcome to the Transposition Cipher
-----------------------------------

1.) Type "encrypt" to encrypt plain text in Transposition Cipher..
2.) Type "decrypt" to decrypt plain text from Transposition Cipher..
3.) Type "encrypt <key> <filename>" to encrypt the plain text file in Transposition Cipher.
4.) Type "decrypt <key> <filename>" to decryot the plain text file from Transposition Cipher.
5.) Type "about" to know about Transposition Cipher.
6.) Type "kill <address of a file>" to delete that file.

Note: 1.) Though we are providing "kill" keyword, it would be better if you close the terminal directly from close button.
      2.) Your key must always be greater than 2 (excluded), otherwise, we are unable to decrypt it.
      3.) There is a small bug in the program and that is that when you use "encrypt" command, sometimes the key you
	  choose will give error while decrypting. So, it is advised that after encrypting with a key, you must decrypt
          your code at the same time and see if there is a "fatal error". If it is there choose a different key.
